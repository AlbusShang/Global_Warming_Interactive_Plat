# Country: Canada (Canada, CAN)

## Region: North America  
## Status: Developed country  
## Current leader: Justin Trudeau



## I. International Commitments

Canada is a Party to the Paris Agreement and submitted an updated nationally determined contribution (NDC). Under its current commitment, Canada aims to:

- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by **40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030**
- Achieve net-zero emissions **by 2050**

Canada plays an active role in international climate diplomacy and climate finance, particularly in supporting mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries.



## II. Domestic Policies

Canada’s domestic climate framework is anchored in the **Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act**, which legally enshrines the 2050 net-zero goal and requires the government to set interim targets and report progress.

A key policy instrument is **economy-wide carbon pricing**, which applies either through a federal backstop system or equivalent provincial systems. Regulations on clean electricity, methane emissions, and vehicle efficiency complement carbon pricing.

Canada is also investing in clean energy, electrification, and climate adaptation, while addressing emissions from energy-intensive sectors, such as oil and gas.



## III. Are These Policies Sufficient?

- Canada has established a robust legal and institutional framework for long-term emission reduction.

- Carbon pricing provides an economy-wide signal that supports cost-effective mitigation across sectors.

- Investments in clean electricity and electric vehicles are contributing to gradual emissions reductions.

- However, emissions from the oil and gas sector remain a major challenge, slowing overall progress.

- International assessments generally rate Canada’s climate action as **insufficient** for the 1.5°C goal, despite relatively strong policy instruments.

- Stronger implementation, particularly in fossil fuel production and heavy industry, is required to meet stated targets.
