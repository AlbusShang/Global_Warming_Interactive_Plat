1. When was the Paris Agreement signed? B
A. 2005
B. 2015
C. 2025
D. 1995

The agreement was adopted by 195 members of the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015, and was enforced in November 2016.

2. Which of the following is NOT a greenhouse gas? C
A. CO2
B. O3
C. H2O
D. N2

Being the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, nitrogen is not a greenhouse gas (GHG). Other examples of GHG include CH4 and NOx. 

3. When does the Paris Agreement aim to reach carbon neutrality globally? B
A. 2045
B. 2050
C. 2055
D. 2060

The goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit the rise in temperature to 2°C by 2100 - and if possible 1.5°C – in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

4. The current CO2 level is about what level? D
A. 410 ppm
B. 415 ppm
C. 420 ppm
D. 425 ppm

The pre-industrial level is 280 ppm, while currently it is 428 ppm (https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu). It is keeping rising. 

5. What impacts will global warming bring to the global rain patterns? A
A. Dry place drier, wet place wetter
B. Dry place drier, wet place drier
C. Dry place wetter, wet place wetter
D. Dry place wetter, wet place drier

Global warming will intensify air convection and accelerate the water cycle. It won't alter the convection or the precipitation pattern, but will only intensify it. Thus, the spatial distribution pattern will be more uneven, and the occurrence of extreme weather will rise. 

6. What is the curve that shows how the atmospheric CO2 level changes over time called? D
A. The Stefan Curve
B. The Moho Curve
C. The Bjerneks Curve
D. The Keeling Curve

The Keeling Curve is a daily record of global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration maintained by Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. They were started by C. David Keeling in March 1958.

7. Which institution is responsible for updating the Keeling Curve? B
A. UCSB
B. UCSD
C. UCLA
D. UCB

The Keeling Curve is a daily record of global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration maintained by Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. They were started by C. David Keeling in March 1958.

8. Which part of the world experiences the most global warming? D
A. The equator
B. The subtropical high
C. The subpolar low
D. The two poles

Because of the positive feedback brought by icesheets (albedo effect), the higher the latitude is, the larger the extent of warming a place will experience. 

9. When El Niño arrives, which part of the Pacific Ocean will become warmer? B
A. The West Coast
B. The East Coast
C. Both
D. Neither

During El Niño, warm water in the Pacific Ocean moves from the western Pacific toward the eastern Pacific. This makes the ocean near the west coast of the Americas (the eastern Pacific) warmer than usual, while the western Pacific becomes relatively cooler.


10. When La Niña arrives, which part of the Pacific Ocean will become warmer? A
A. The West Coast
B. The East Coast
C. Both
D. Neither

During La Niña, strong trade winds push warm surface water toward the western Pacific. This makes the ocean near Asia and Australia (the western Pacific) warmer, while the eastern Pacific becomes cooler than usual.

11. Others being equal, which night will be warmer? A
A. Cloudy night
B. Clear-sky night
C. Same
D. No fixed answer

Clouds act like a blanket for the Earth. They trap heat and stop it from escaping into space, so the ground cools down more slowly. On a clear night, heat escapes easily, so it gets colder.


12. An object can emit radiation that is proportional to D
A. its temperature
B. the square of its temperature
C. the cube of its temperature
D. the quadruple of its temperature

The amount of radiation an object emits increases very fast as the temperature rises. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy emitted is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, so even a small temperature increase can cause a big rise in radiation.

13. When the air temperature rises, the amount of water vapor the air can hold without condensation will A
A. increase exponentially
B. increase linearly
C. decrease exponentially
D. decrease exponentially

Warm air can hold much more water vapor than cold air. As temperature rises, the air’s capacity for water vapor increases very quickly (not just in a straight line), which is why warmer climates often have heavier rain and stronger storms.


14. Which of the following constitutes the vast majority of freshwater?? C
A. River
B. Groundwater
C. Glacier
D. Lake

Glaciers contribute to 69% of the total freshwater on Earth. However, it is important to note that freshwater accounts for only ~3% of all water resources. 

15. Which of the following cannot magnify the global warming effect? B
A. The solubility of CO2 in the ocean
B. The volcanic ashes in the atmosphere
C. The albedo of ice sheets

The solubility decreases as the temperature increases. Thus, the ocean cannot store the same amount of CO2 as it could before under the circumstances of global warming. Some CO2 will re-enter the atmosphere and intensify the greenhouse effect. As the temperature increases, ice will melt. As ice sheets can reflect a large amount of solar radiation into space, a lack of ice sheets means that the ground has to absorb more solar radiation, so it gets warmer more rapidly. The volcanic ashes can partially block the solar radiation and prevent it from warming the ground. 

16. In the troposphere, as the altitude increases by 1km, the air temperature will decrease by C
A. 5.5 oC
B. 6.0 oC
C. 6.5 oC
D. 7.0 oC

This is the lapse rate: -6.5 °C/km. 


17. What is the most significant feature of the Mediterranean Climate? B
A. Warmth and rain throughout the year
B. Warm in summer, but rainy in winter
C. Never rains
D. Cooler than other places of the same latitude

In the summer, such places are controlled by subpolar high pressure, which is hot and dry; in winter, it is dominated by the Westerlies from the ocean, bringing an abundance of moisture. The Mediterranean Climate exists around the western coast of the subtropical region, such as Spain and Italy. 

18. Where is the Hadley Cell? A
A. In the low latitude
B. In the mid-latitude
C. In the high latitude

Warm air rises from the equator and flows to 30 °, where it condenses and flows back to the equator. It forms the Hadley Cell, which exists in both hemispheres. The Ferrel Cell is in the mid-latitude while the Polar Cell is in the high-latitude.
