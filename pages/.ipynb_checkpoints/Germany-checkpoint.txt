## I. International Commitments

Germany is a Party to the Paris Agreement and, as an EU Member State, participates in the European Union’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) submitted **on behalf of the EU and its Member States**. The EU’s updated NDC commits to a **net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels** (including the land sector).  
(As an EU Member State, Germany’s international commitment is closely tied to this EU-wide target and the associated EU policy architecture.)

In parallel, Germany has codified ambitious long-term objectives domestically (see Section II), which function as the country’s core pathway for delivering its EU-level obligations.

## II. Domestic Policies

Germany’s central legal framework is the **Federal Climate Change Act (Klimaschutzgesetz / Climate Change Act)**, which—after amendments—enshrines the goal of **greenhouse gas neutrality by 2045** and tightens the 2030 target to **at least 65% reduction vs. 1990**.

To operationalize these goals, the federal government has adopted economy-wide packages and sectoral measures. Notably, the federal cabinet adopted the **Climate Action Programme 2023**, designed to reduce emissions across all major sectors and support compliance with the Climate Change Act pathway.

In addition to mitigation, Germany has strengthened its adaptation planning. In late 2024, the federal government published a new **German Climate Adaptation Strategy** with measurable targets, as required by the Federal Climate Adaptation Act framework.

## III. Are These Policies Sufficient?

- **Germany has clear, legally anchored targets**: climate neutrality by **2045** and at least **65% emissions reduction by 2030** compared with 1990 levels, providing a binding long-term direction.

- **Policy implementation is structured through national programmes**, including the **Climate Action Programme 2023**, which bundles cross-sector and sector-specific measures to close gaps toward the 2030 target.  
  Source: BMWE/BMWK. 

- **Adaptation policy is becoming more target-driven**, with the 2024 strategy explicitly framed around measurable goals for managing climate risks.  
  Source: BMUV. 

- **However, independent international assessment still finds the overall package insufficient for 1.5°C alignment**. The Climate Action Tracker rates Germany’s overall climate targets, policies, and finance as **“Insufficient.”**  
  Source: Climate Action Tracker (Germany profile). 

- CAT further notes a mixed picture: Germany’s **“Policies & action”** are assessed as **“Almost sufficient”** against modelled domestic pathways, but implemented policies put the **2030 target “at risk”** and are not enough for long-term goals without additional strengthening.  
  Source: Climate Action Tracker (Policies & action). 

- A recurrent weakness highlighted across assessments is the **difficulty of delivering reductions in lagging sectors (especially transport and buildings)**, which can undermine the credibility of post-2030 and net-zero trajectories even if near-term progress improves.
