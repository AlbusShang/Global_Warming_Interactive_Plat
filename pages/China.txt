## I. International Commitments

China is one of the signatories to the Paris Agreement, which it joined in 2015. Under its nationally determined contributions (NDCs), China aims to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by **7–10% from peak levels before 2035**.

Key commitments include:
- Raising the share of **non-fossil energy** in total energy consumption to **over 30%**
- Expanding **wind and solar power capacity** to **six times their 2020 levels**
- Increasing **forest stock volume** to **more than 24 billion cubic meters**

At the diplomatic level, China actively advances head-of-state diplomacy and promotes international cooperation through major multilateral platforms, including the G20, BRICS, the World Trade Organization (WTO), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the Boao Forum for Asia.

In addition, China promotes **South–South cooperation on climate change** and advances the development of a **Green Belt and Road Initiative**, integrating climate considerations into overseas investment and infrastructure projects.

## II. Domestic Policies

On the domestic policy front, China is gradually implementing a range of climate- and energy-related laws, including the **Energy Law**, **Electric Power Law**, and **Coal Law**, which together provide a legal framework for the country’s energy transition.

China is also strongly promoting **domestically produced new energy vehicles**, particularly those manufactured by BYD, as part of its strategy to decarbonize the transport sector.

In urban and rural development, China is advancing a **green and low-carbon transition**, while actively implementing large-scale ecological projects such as the **Three-North Shelterbelt Program**, aimed at combating desertification and enhancing carbon sinks.

Furthermore, a wide range of **low-carbon public awareness initiatives** are being organized, including **National Ecology Day**, **Energy Conservation Publicity Week**, **Low-Carbon Day**, **World Water Day**, and other related campaigns designed to promote environmental awareness and behavioral change.

## III. Are These Policies Sufficient?

- China’s current policies have **successfully slowed emissions growth**, with total emissions declining by approximately **1% year-on-year in the first half of the year**.

- **Rapid renewable energy deployment** has been the main driver of progress, as wind and solar generation growth has outpaced electricity demand growth, lifting renewables to **nearly 40% of total power generation**.

- Several **2030 NDC targets** have already been **met or exceeded**, particularly those related to **wind and solar capacity installation** and **forest stock volume**.

- The **clean energy transition** is increasingly aligned with **economic growth**, suggesting a partial decoupling of emissions from GDP expansion.

- However, **current policies and targets remain insufficient**, as international assessments rate China’s overall climate action as **“Highly insufficient”** relative to the **1.5°C temperature goal**.

- The **2035 emissions reduction target lacks ambition**, because projected emissions under existing policies are already expected to decline by a similar or greater margin **without additional measures**.

- China is likely to **miss its carbon intensity reduction targets** under both the **14th Five-Year Plan** and the **2030 NDC**, revealing a gap between **structural economic transition** and **policy stringency**.

- Key mitigation areas remain underdeveloped, particularly the **absence of absolute emissions caps in heavy industry**, which continues to constrain deeper decarbonization.
