## I. International Commitments

India is a Party to the Paris Agreement and submitted its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) in 2022. Under its current commitments, India aims to:

- Reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by **45% from 2005 levels by 2030**
- Achieve **about 50% of cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil energy sources by 2030**
- Create an additional **2.5–3 billion tonnes of CO₂-equivalent carbon sinks** through forest and tree cover

India has also announced a long-term goal of achieving **net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070**.

At the international level, India actively participates in multilateral climate negotiations under the UNFCCC and plays a leading role in South–South cooperation. It is a founding member of initiatives such as the **International Solar Alliance (ISA)** and promotes climate finance, technology transfer, and capacity building for developing countries.

## II. Domestic Policies

Domestically, India’s climate action is guided by a mix of national missions, sectoral policies, and long-term strategies.

Key initiatives include the **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)**, which comprises multiple national missions focused on solar energy, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, water, and ecosystem protection.

India has made rapid progress in **renewable energy deployment**, particularly solar and wind power, supported by large-scale auctions and declining technology costs. The country is also expanding electrification and promoting clean cooking fuels and energy access.

In parallel, India continues to rely heavily on coal to meet rising energy demand, while investing in efficiency improvements and cleaner technologies for thermal power generation.

## III. Are These Policies Sufficient?

- India has **strengthened its international commitments**, notably by raising its renewable energy and emissions intensity targets in its updated NDC.

- **Renewable energy expansion has accelerated**, making India one of the world’s largest markets for solar power and contributing to slower growth in emissions intensity.

- The **net-zero by 2070 target provides long-term direction**, but remains distant and lacks detailed near-term implementation pathways.

- However, India’s **absolute emissions continue to rise**, driven by economic growth, population increase, and continued coal dependence.

- International assessments generally find India’s climate targets to be **insufficient for the 1.5°C goal**, although they are often rated more favorably when considering development constraints.

- A key challenge remains balancing **development priorities and poverty reduction** with the pace and scale of emissions reductions required for global climate stabilization.
