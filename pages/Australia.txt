## I. International Commitments

Australia is a Party to the Paris Agreement and submitted an updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) in 2022. Under its current commitment, Australia aims to:

- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by **43% below 2005 levels by 2030**
- Achieve **net-zero emissions by 2050**

Australia participates actively in UNFCCC processes and regional climate cooperation in the Asia–Pacific, with a growing emphasis on climate finance, adaptation support, and clean energy partnerships.

## II. Domestic Policies

Domestically, Australia’s climate policy framework has undergone significant change in recent years.

The federal government has legislated the **2030 emissions reduction target** and the net-zero by 2050 goal, providing long-term policy certainty. Climate action is supported through mechanisms such as the **Safeguard Mechanism**, which places declining emissions limits on large industrial facilities.

Australia is rapidly expanding **renewable energy generation**, particularly solar and wind, supported by strong resource endowments and declining costs. Investments in grid infrastructure, energy storage, and green hydrogen are also increasing.

At the same time, Australia remains a major **exporter of fossil fuels**, especially coal and liquefied natural gas, which continues to shape domestic and international climate debates.

## III. Are These Policies Sufficient?

- Australia has **significantly strengthened its climate targets** compared with earlier commitments, improving policy credibility.

- **Renewable energy deployment is progressing quickly**, and electricity-sector emissions are declining.

- Legislative backing for climate targets has enhanced **policy stability and investor confidence**.

- However, Australia’s **overall emissions reduction pathway is not aligned with the 1.5°C temperature goal**, according to international assessments.

- Continued expansion of **fossil fuel exports** and limited constraints on upstream production weaken the effectiveness of domestic mitigation efforts.

- Greater ambition and faster action are needed in **industry, transport, and land-use sectors** to close the gap between targets and climate science.
