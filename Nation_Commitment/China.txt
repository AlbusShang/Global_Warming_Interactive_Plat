### I. International Commitments

#### China is one of the many members that signed the Paris Agreement in 2015. It aims to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 7–10% from the peak level before 2035. 

This includes ：
- Raising the share of non-fossil energy in total energy consumption to over 30%
- Expanding wind and solar power capacity to six times their 2020 levels
- Increasing forest stock volume to more than 24 billion cubic meters.

At the same time, China vigorously advances head-of-state diplomacy and actively promotes cooperation through major multilateral platforms, including the G20, BRICS, the World Trade Organization (WTO), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the Boao Forum for Asia. 

China also promotes South–South cooperation on climate change and advances the development of a Green Belt and Road Initiative.

### II. Domestic Policies
'
#### On the domestic policy front, China is gradually implementing a range of relevant laws, including the Energy Law, the Electric Power Law, and the Coal Law. 

It is also strongly promoting domestically produced new energy vehicles, such as those manufactured by BYD.

In urban and rural development, China is advancing a green and low-carbon transition and actively carrying out the “Three-North Shelterbelt Program.” 

In addition, a variety of low-carbon public awareness initiatives are being organized, including National Ecology Day, Energy Conservation Publicity Week, Low-Carbon Day, World Water Day, and other related campaigns.

### III. Are these policies sufficient? What is the projected warming magnitude?

#### 
- China’s current policies have successfully slowed emissions growth, with emissions declining by about 1% year-on-year in the first half of the year.

- Rapid renewable energy deployment has been the main driver of progress, as wind and solar generation growth has outpaced electricity demand growth, lifting renewables to nearly 40% of total power generation.

- Several 2030 NDC targets have already been met or exceeded, notably wind and solar capacity installation and forest stock volume.

- The clean energy transition is increasingly aligned with economic growth.

- However, current policies and targets remain insufficient, as international assessments rate China’s overall climate action as “Highly insufficient” relative to the 1.5°C temperature goal.

- The 2035 emissions reduction target lacks ambition, because projected emissions under existing policies are already expected to fall by a similar or greater margin without additional measures.

- China is likely to miss its carbon intensity reduction targets under both the 14th Five-Year Plan and the 2030 NDC, revealing a gap between structural transition and policy stringency.

- Key mitigation areas remain underdeveloped, particularly in the areas of absolute emissions caps for heavy industry.
